# Data sources for the Wednesday World Cup

## LSV
LSV has published data on WC 2018 and Euro 2020.
Their data is really good since it comes with a blank json (no games played, but lists team sources, like winner of group A) and a complete one, with all the games played.

## Fixture download
The data have game scores but no team sources, they also don't provide penalties, so some playoff games are listed as draws.

## Football-data API
A proper API, but their free plan does not support giving historical records.
It is a potential solution for live updating during a tournament, but I might need some kind of early access to prototype it.
